# house-price-prediction

In this project, I applied Linear Regression to predict housing prices and mobile phone prices using the dataset: USA_Housing.csv The goal was to analyze the relationships between different features and the target variable (Price).

I performed the following steps:

Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas, visualized data distributions with Seaborn, and observed feature correlations using heatmaps.
Selected key features like income, house age, and population as inputs and the Price column as the target.
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
Trained a Linear Regression model, obtained the coefficients, and visualized the predictions with scatter plots and error distributions.
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like RMSE.
